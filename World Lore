[B][U]Dragons[/U][/B]: Dragons have 7 life stages: egg, wyrmling, young, juvenile, adult, old, and ancient. The age ranges are as follows:
0-100: Egg
100-250: Wyrmling (CR 5)
250-500: Young (CR 10)
500-1000: Juvenile (CR 15)
1000-2000: Adult (CR 20)
2000-5000: Old (CR 25)
5000+: Ancient (CR 30)

Dragons typically do not live to be older than 10,000 years of age. Once they reach about 8000 years old, they become sluggish and inactive, often choosing to hide away in the deep recesses of the multiverse and sleep or "hibernate" until their consciousness eventually just melds gradually into their Dragonsoul. All dragons of a particular species share a collective Dragonsoul, and there are eighteen distinct Dragonsouls. It is said that when the last dragon dies, the spirits of each genus will merge to form three Dragonsouls: the Metallic, the Crystal, and the Chromatic.
A Dragonsoul is a spirit which can choose to take the form of a physical dragon and embodies and epitomizes everything about that particular species of dragon. The Dragonsoul is the symbol, the platonic form, of the species, and is considered the "mother spirit" of that species (although the spirit is by no means always necessarily feminine; it can take different forms and genders depending upon whom it appears to). The Dragonsoul is the summation of all the knowledge shared by all former dragons of that species. In many ways it is a pool of dragon spirits, and yet it is also one single spirit, the archetype of all dragons of that color.

There are three genuses and eighteen species of dragon, within the family draco:
[U]Draco Chromatus[/U]: Chromatic dragons, typically evil, include: [I]black, blue, green, orange, red, and white dragons[/I].
[U]Draco Metallus[/U]: Metallic dragons, typically good, include: [I]copper, gold, iron, lead, silver, and titanium dragons[/I].
[U]Draco Crystallus[/U]: Crystal (or gemstone) dragons, typically neutral, include: [I]amethyst, diamond, emerald, ruby, sapphire, and topaz dragons[/I].

[B][U]Gods[/U][/B]: The standard D&D pantheon of worshipped gods still exists, but the names are slightly different in my campaign. In addition, there are three other tiers of gods, the known pantheon being the second lowest of the four. The tiers are: Elu the One; the Aéa, or the Fates; the major gods; and the minor gods.

[i][u]Tier 1[/u][/i]
The first tier consists of One God alone. Elu, the Timeless One, the Luminous One, The Nameless One, Truth, Love, Beauty, Good. Elu exists outside of existence and outside of time. He is the connection between the beginning of time and the end of time. He created the Aéa, or the Fates, and placed in their hands the duty of creating the multiverse. Elu is the essence of Beauty, Truth, Love. He is the True Form of Goodness and sustains all existence. Nothing is greater than Elu, and nothing is outside of Elu. The very passage of time itself is contained within and sustained by the mind of Elu; he controls the intercourse of the dimensions, and the interaction between the physical world and the passage of time. Very, very few mortals know of the existence of Elu, but he loves and sustains them all, and all mortals are teleologically destined for unity with Elu. Those who go to Tâiva when they die are able to behold him in his full splendor and take part in his perfect Divinity. Those who go to Séppeca when they die are eternally separated from Elu, and their suffering is their lack of him. Elu is Lawful Good. When the multiverse ends, Tâiva and Séppeca will end with it, and there will only be Elu. Those who were in Tâiva will be enveloped within Elu, while those who were in Séppeca will be outside of Elu.

[i][u]Tier 2[/u][/i]
The second tier consists of three gods, or Aéa, or Fates. The three Aéa are Almé, Imré, and Ulré. Every action taken by the Fates is a direct extension of the power and will of Elu. The Aéa are merely the instruments through which Elu interacts with creation. Everything they do is in perfect accord with his will and plan. At the end of time the Aéa will stand around the throne of Elu, closer to him than any mortal.
[list][*]Almé is the Builder, who was tasked by Elu with the creation of the multiverse. Everything that exists, including the third tier of gods, came into being through Almé. Every new life that comes into the multiverse is given its spark by the breath of Almé. Almé is Lawful Good.
[*]Imré is the Sustainer, who was tasked by Elu with maintaining the works of Almé. The responsibility of every new work that Almé creates is immediately handed over to Imré the instant it comes into existence. The energy of Imré keeps the multiverse progressing. Imré is Neutral Good.
[*]Ulré is the Destroyer. When it is time for something to cease existing, Ulré snuffs it out. When a mortal life ends, Ulré plucks soul from body and carries it to Elu. Ulré ends what Almé begins. When the multiverse eventually ends, Ulré will extinguish the stars one by one and fold up the corners of the multiverse like the back cover of a finished book, concluding existence and presenting the entire epic narrative to Elu. Ulré is Chaotic Good.[/list]

[B][U]Planes[/U][/B]: The Nine Planes of the Omniverse:

[U][I]Tâiva:[/I][/U] Heaven, an Outer Planes. All good aligned mortals enter this plane when they die. It is divided into three separate sub-planes for Law (Aido), Neutrality (Olto), and Chaos (Kaefo). Gemstones, minerals, and metals such as benvolite and celestium originate in this plane.
[U][I]Séppeca:[/I][/U] Hell, an Outer Plane. All evil aligned mortals enter this plane when they die. It is divided into three separate sub-planes for Law (Baatus), Neutrality (Vîrkus), and Chaos (Chasmus). Gemstones, minerals, and metals such as abyssium and malignite originate in this plane.
[U][I]The Radiant Firmament:[/I][/U] The Plane of Light, one of the two Outer Planes that separate Tâiva and Séppeca, and insulate them from one another. This plane envelopes Tâiva and keeps it separate from the rest of the multiverse. Often referred to as the Auroramorn, very little is known about this mysterious plane, or the strange and alien presences, beings of brilliance and light, which may or may not lurk there. Gemstones, minerals, and metals such as dawnrock, gleamstone, illumitine, and scintilite originate in this plane.
[U][I]The Umbral Ocean:[/I][/U] The Plane of Dark, one of the two Outer Planes that separate Tâiva and Séppeca, and insulate them from one another. This plane envelopes Séppeca and keeps it separate from the rest of the multiverse. Often referred to as the Shadowfell, very little is known about this mysterious plane, or the strange and alien presences, beings of dusk and darkness, which may or may not lurk there. Gemstones, minerals, and metals such as dimmitine, duskrock, gloomstone, and umbralite originate in this plane.
[U][I]The Feywild:[/I][/U]  The Plane of Twilight, or the Faeriemist, is the bridge that connects The Radiant Firmament and The Umbral Ocean. It is in a constant state of twilight with an ever setting sun. It is directly linked to the Ghostly Parallel and is one of the most efficient routes between the Inner and Outer Planes. Gemstones, minerals, and metals such as faeriegold, feyrock, seelium, and twylite originate on this plane.
[U][I]The Astral Vacuum:[/I][/U] The Astral Plane, neither an Inner nor Outer Plane. Sometimes called "the Space Between Planes", this plane surrounds and envelops the other planes, providing a means of passage between the Inner and Outer Planes. Perhaps the most abstract of the planes, and sometimes considered a "non-plane" or "anti-plane", the Astral Vacuum is the space in which all other planes float. The only means of passage between the Inner and Outer Planes are the Astral Vacuum and the Feywild. Gemstones, minerals, and metals such as astralite, nihilite, and oblivium originate in this plane.
[U][I]Cartölis:[/I][/U] The Material Plane, an Inner Plane. This is the physical universe, the Greatworld on which all physical mortals reside during their life. Aeord is the planet upon which all known life resides.
[U][I]The Ghostly Parallel:[/I][/U] The Ethereal Plane, an Inner Plane. This plane is coexistent with Cartölis. It overlaps the Material Plane and the two almost seem to act as reflections of one another, two sides of the same coin. Immaterial essences such as ghosts and incorporeal creatures reside in the Ghostly Parallel. Gemstones, minerals, and metals such as ghostrock, phantasmium, and specterstone originate on this plane.
[U][I]The Elemental Sea:[/I][/U] The Plane of Elements and Energy, an Inner Plane. This plane is home to the essences of all the elements of Aeord, as well as the energies that power the Material Plane. It is divided into four main sub-planes: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. Each of those sub-planes contains two vectors, or aspects: Positive and Negative. These Energies effect the Elements in varying mysterious ways. Gemstones, minerals, and metals such as ignium, maritine, truestone, and zephyrite originate on this plane.

[COLOR="Blue"][U][I]And in Case it Matters:[/I][/U] As you may have noticed, there is no plane for neutral characters. In the end, neutral characters are either leaning toward good or evil, and they go to either Tâiva or Séppeca depending on that.
Tâiva and Séppeca each have different levels of intensity, much like both the Paradiso and the Inferno in Dante's Divine Comedy. It would be accurate to think of Tâiva as a mountain, and of Séppeca as a pit.
The closer you are to the peak of the mountain, the more intensely good you were during your life. If you reside at the base of the mountain, you could say you "barely made it in" as it were, or you were neutral but in the end your goodness outweighed your evil.
The same goes for the pit. In the very depths are the most evil mortals ever to live, while at the lip reside the neutral characters who were just a tad too selfish or otherwise immoral during their lives to be eligible for Tâiva.
The joy and suffering also exist in varying degrees of intensity in these cases.
Those on the lip of the pit would hardly suffer at all, but would instead live monotonous but satisfying afterlives. Whereas those on the base of the mountain would be happy, but it would be closer to contentment than real overflowing joy.[/COLOR]

[B][U]Planetouched[/U][/B]: There are two types of Planetouched, Celestial and Fiendish. These types are divided further into subtypes: the Celestial subtypes are aasimar and siyamar, and the Fiendish subtypes are tiefling and fienling. Aasimar and tieflings are born of outsider fathers from mortal mothers, while siyamar and fienlings are born of mortal fathers from outsider mothers.[/spoiler]
